# Mealmap

Mealmap is a never-ending project that serves only one purpose: to further the author's education.

At its core it is a RESTful API created with ASP.NET Core 7 MVC and EF Core 7 powering an Angular app, but it is also a playground to tinker with further tools, libraries, design patterns, and "good principles and practices".
